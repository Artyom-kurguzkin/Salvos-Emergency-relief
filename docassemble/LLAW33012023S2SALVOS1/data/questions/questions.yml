  Each year, across Australia, thousands of individuals and families come to The Salvation Army for help.  We help people in crisis meet their immediate needs, because we believe no one should have to go without the essentials. 
  
  Salvos aims to support people seeking emergency relief services. We believe that everyone has the right to access help with the additional support of Salvos employees. 
  
  We aim to help identify and solve the issues relating to homelessness, substance abuse, domestic abuse, allied healthcare and financial hardship. To do this we have provided a relief form to determine what areas are the strongest services to be able to provide support.
