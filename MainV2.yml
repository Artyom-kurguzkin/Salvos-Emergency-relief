While also reducing the current steps to receive support and creating a more accessible environment for all. Please note that the applicationâ€™s advice is not legal advice, and personal information inputted in the form by you is stored and viewed by the Salvos staff and branches to find suitable help for you. By clicking continue, you are agreeing not to treat the app as legal advice and agreeing to store your information.
