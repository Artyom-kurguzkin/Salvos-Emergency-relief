# Overview

This application was built as a prototype for South Australian branch of Salvation Army through joined efforts of law and computer science Flinders University students. 

The app aims to accomplish 2 main purposes. 

- First, to make it easier for people in need to access emergency relief services provided by Salvation Army. The idea is to automate data collection through a web form. The form also has integrated logic component that detects if visitors are not eligible for the service in question or if they can be better served at a different Salvation Army branch. Collected data is written to a pdf file and is sent to a configurable email address. 

- Second, to make the process of applying to emergency relief services provided by Salvation Army more transparent from the legal standpoint. Our law team did thorough research on possible legal issues involved with the services enacted by the application and the surrounding context. We carefully planned what information users of the application may benefit from and integrated it throughout using various UX techniques.
